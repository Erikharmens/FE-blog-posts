# Learning Markdown - Basic Syntax  

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Headings

To create headings place # before the word/sentence. One # is a h1 tag, two # is h2 and so on.

### Emphasis  

You can make your text bold by using two * before and after your word/sentence.  
**This text is bold** 

You can also make your text itallic by using only one * before and after your word/sentence.  
Some of this *text is itallic*
