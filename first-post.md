# Learning Markdown - Basic Syntax  

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Headings

To create headings place # before the word/sentence. One # is a h1 tag, two # is h2 and so on.

### Emphasis  

**This text is bold.**   
You can make your text bold by using two * before and after your word/sentence.  

Some of *this text is italic.*   
You can make your text italic by using one * before and after your word/sentence.  

### Lists  

**Unordered list:**
    Place * or - before the list  
* List Item 1
* List Item 2
   * List Item 2a
   
**Ordered list:** 
    Place 1. before the list 
    
1. List Item 1
1. List Item 2
    1. List Item 2a  
    
### Blockquotes  
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> It will look like this.
>
> Can also be done with multiple paragraphs.  

### Code Blocks  
To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>  
    
Enjoy!
